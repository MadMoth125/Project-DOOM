# Project DOOM
A DOOM (1993) recreation built with Unity.

The project is currently incomplete, as it only includes:
* A single map.
* A controllable character.
* Interactable doors.
* A single enemy type.
* Simple enemy pathfinding.
* Handful of weapons.

# Goals
* To recreate the mechanics found in DOOM using the tools provided in Unity.
* To enhance the visuals by adding PBR properties to common textures.
* To experiment with [Unity's Job system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html) for multi-threading certain scripts.
